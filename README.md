# CodeAlpha_Hangman-Game
This Hangman game is developed as CodeAlpha Internship Task 1. Itâ€™s a simple text-based Python game where players guess a hidden word one letter at a time. It includes ASCII art for wrong guesses, tracks attempts, prevents duplicate guesses, and allows multiple rounds with replay support.
